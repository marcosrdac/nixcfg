    ### Legacy

    # is connected or disconnected which might break follow mode if the screen
    # layout changes.

    # using the resolution and physical size. This might be useful in setups
    # where there are multiple screens with very different dpi values.

[shortcuts]

# SCRIPTING
# You can specify a script that gets run when the rule matches by

#   script appname summary body icon urgency
# where urgency can be "LOW", "NORMAL" or "CRITICAL".
#
# NOTE: if you don't want a notification to be displayed, set the format
# to "".
# NOTE: It might be helpful to run dunst -print in a terminal in order
# to find fitting options for rules.
